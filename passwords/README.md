# Password storage. Hashing

Your task is to create a simple client-server app (it may be just a web-app with front and back) with client authentication. You should use the best practices of credential storage: strong hash, salt, strong password requirements, honey pots etc. Everything that you find necessary for the maximum password storage security. 
You may want to reference owasp cheat sheets or any other reliable source of information to help you with this task.

Upload all your results to a public github repository.

Create front and back for user registration and login. You may use any framework you find comfortable to work with. After successful login you just need to at least output the result of login, but itâ€™s not required to manage sessions, use cookies, or redirect users to some other page. The task is simply to check if login and password are indeed correct.
Many frameworks have these functions already implemented. Your job then is to modify the functionality in such a way that password storage is reliable.
Write a short report, in which include:
what algorithms/tools/security measures you chose and why
if applicable, what framework did you use, what were default security measures included and what changes you had to make in order to comply with best practices.

This task will be graded based on your code and report.
